# Droid Builder - Java 

Object oriented programming used to test OOP in Java and compare the difference between Java and C++ OOP. Developed a simple Droid project where the programmer
can develop a droid. The methods included are the droids access to it's stats. Which is a toString method which declares the Droid's name and battery level. The additoinal methods are to perform a task, check the battery level of the droid, and the recharge the droid using a conditional statement to see if it is at 100%. 


Two droids were tested: R2D2 and BB8. 

R2D2's task was performed to check to see if public variable battery is altered. Then, rechraged to check conditional.
